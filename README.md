# Data Analyst Projects â€“ MySQL  

This repository contains my SQL projects focusing on Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using MySQL.

## Projects

**Data Cleaning of Company Layoffs Dataset**
Tools: MySQL, SQL Window Functions, String Functions
- Cleaned and transformed ~10,000 records of a real-world company layoffs dataset using MySQL.
- Removed duplicates, standardized inconsistent fields, and converted text dates to DATE format to create an analysis-ready dataset.
- Handled missing/blank values via self-joins and deletions, reducing manual cleaning time and improving data accuracy.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
Tools: MySQL, CTEs, Aggregations, Window Functions
- Analyzed the cleaned layoffs dataset to uncover trends and patterns by company, location, country, industry, and year.
- Used SQL aggregations and window functions (e.g., DENSE_RANK) to identify top companies with the highest layoffs per year.
- Created rolling totals and summary metrics to show layoff trends over time for data-driven decision-making.
